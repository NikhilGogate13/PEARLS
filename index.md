Visualizing multi-dimensional data is complex, difficult and well studied topic. Most solutions visualizing multi-dimensional data suffer from problems like over-plotting, messy, etc. PEARLS solution aims at solving this problems and also tries to provide fast, convinient data cleaning interface for some basic use-cases.
